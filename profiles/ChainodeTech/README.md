# Chainode Tech

We are a young, extremely motivated and experienced team focused on providing validation services for Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). The team was founded almost one year ago, in Zug, Switzerland, time in which we joined multiple quality projects in the blockchain space that are focused on solving technical challenges while pursuing decentralization. 

With relevant experience in the blockchain area such as blockchain based architecture solutions for state companies in Switzerland or cybersecurity solutions for the decentralized space, Chainode Tech does not stop at simply providing validation services but gets involved in the growth of their ecosystems as well. We supported projects from their initial stages by providing validation services as well as by bringing our contribution to their growth through community development, marketing strategies or building technical tools. 
 

## Team


| Name             | Role    | Description                  |
| ---------------  | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Ionut Scirlet | Founder | Blockchain Solution Architect    |
| Ilinca Alexiuc  | Co-Founder     | Business Growth Manager |

## Our Architecture

We use mostly cloud setups, from bare metals to VPS servers on multiple cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean, Vultr and other cloud providers to avoid outages and have redundancy for our validators. The access to our validators is being made by using MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) based on HSM (Hardware Security Modules). Although we use templates and references for the architecture, the design of the final solutions is being made for each blockchain protocol in part as there are many parameters influencing it like hardware and network requirements, uptime, slashing, signing and key design.
