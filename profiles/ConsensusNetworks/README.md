## Our Architecture

Consensus Networks offers a multi-cloud, hybridized network architecture that is spread across our own physical infrastructure and key management in data centers and public cloud providers. We use highly available sentry architectures to limit public internet connectivity to our validator node. 

## Ecosystem Contributions

We have been involved in the NuCypher community since CASI and successfully completed all four phases. We are actively looking for projects to integrate NuCypher with and are eager to contribute our development, infrastructure, or research capabilities where we feel we can add value. We are excited about the future of NuCypher and would love to collaborate with other parties interested in building products and tools to advance the future of privacy-preserving technologies using the protocol.
