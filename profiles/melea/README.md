## Our Architecture and good practices


Our Servers are distributed in several data centers around worldwide, with the best security measures, also, we change servers regularly to have the latest hardware and security standards necessary to offer high availability of 99.91% Connected servers.Count with protection against DDoS attacks and a monitoring team pending everything that happens on each server and service at all times 24x7.

We have been validating blocks since 2017 and we have that experience and track record you need so you don't have to worry about a thing, we do all the work for you.
We are not new to the world of blockchain or Staking services and you can see that reflected in our Portfolio in which we have 14 Blockchain companies that we currently offer support to ensure their blockchain in a professional way and offer the staking service. Currently securing more than 3 Millions of Dollars in externals delegations or nominations. You can check this info on our website and the different explorers of each blockchain.


Our central and unique headquarters for the moment is located in Europe in the city of Barcelona in Spain. Our Founder is Portuguese but he lived for a large part of his life in Latin America, which is why we focus our work on evangelism of staking with the Hispanic community at the same time as with all of the English-speaking community as well.

We are a startup and we are in the process of growth and development, have you Staking with us and benefit from the future facilities and surprises that we have for our delegates, nominators and members of our community.

We are concerned about the life and proper functioning of all the blockchain we are working for and that is why we are advocates of decentralization continuously and we express it publicly all the time, we want the best for the communities we work for, we do not just seek economic benefit. 

We are the validation service you are looking for, try us, and if you think we can offer you a better service, let us know! we are close, we listen and care about you.

NOTE: Since validating we have never suffered from any penalties AkA slashes, and we plan to keep that record clean.

Happy Staking
