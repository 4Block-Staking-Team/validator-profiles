## Our Architecture

**Highly Reliable and Secure**

We use Kubernetes to distribute across multiple cloud providers, and have never been slashed, hacked, or experienced extended downtime in 2+ years of operation.

**Non-Custodial**

You are in complete control of your private keys and funds throughout the staking process.

**Flexible Go-To-Market**

Delegate to our public validator or let us operate a separate white-labeled validator on your behalf.

**Broad Asset Coverage**

Live on 20 PoS mainnets including Tezos, Cosmos, Decred, Terra and Livepeer. Operating on 15+ testnets launching in 2020 including Polkadot, Cardano, Keep, NuCypher, Oasis and Centrifuge.

**Block-Level Reporting**

Designed for funds admins and accountants, the reporting includes all staking and delegation transactions on a calendar basis.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We are active members of the NuCypher community and have been supporting the chain since the launch of the testnet and WorkLock. We have never been slashed as a node-as-a-service provider.
