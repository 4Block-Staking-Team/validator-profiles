If we could describe the business relationship we have with our clients in one word, it would be TRUST. We gained their trust by being there for them every step of the way (24/7), proactively helping them to grow, and by providing the support they need. We do not look for a ‘quick win’ and we know that choosing a staking partner is a big decision, so take your time. Get to know us better and feel free to contact us when YOU are ready.

# Team

We operate validators on various projects. Token holders can stake with us to help secure these networks and earn staking rewards.

# Our Architecture
Colocated in a data center TIA-942 Tier III

State-of-the-art Cisco equipment. The network model is a redundant “2n” type, which means that for any key network equipment there is an identical one that is ready to take over all traffic in case of an unwanted event or scheduled work without this having an impact on services. All of these factors lead to a network uptime of 99.99%.

Our protection against cyber attacks is based on a “packet” traffic analysis solution and high performance hardware equipped with 40GE network interfaces. The attack cleanup capability is 140Gbps / 20Mpps.

Connectivity in our data center is achieved through stable interconnections with major national and international operators with peering of over 140Gbps. Thus, in our data center you will benefit from stable internet connectivity and 99.99% uptime guaranteed by SLA
For the Exchange and Core layer, we use “6500E” series equipment equipped with Supervisor “2T XL” that guarantees the uninterrupted transit of any traffic and meets all the needs of a modern network.
The distribution and aggregation layer was built using Cisco 4500 series (4900M, 4948-10GE).
