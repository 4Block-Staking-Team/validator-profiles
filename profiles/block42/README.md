We believe in a world of shared prosperity. In our opinion public and permissionless blockchain technology is the fundamental technology that will change our world to the better. With that in mind we follow a holistic approach where we buy stakes in various crypto networks, run validator nodes, but also focus on bringing adoption to those ecosystems by developing applications for both the community as well as our clients.
