# Stakin

![Stakin-staking-illustration-provider](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*N0mmwtmb6CPPEVnU)

Stakin is an infrastructure operator for Proof-of-stake (PoS) public blockchain, offering public delegation and staking-as-a-service.

At Stakin, the whole team is very optimist on the future of Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. We believe it can improve the distribution of wealth and leads us towards a better-decentralized future while being energy-efficient and thus sustainable.

Our intention is to build a staking service first and foremost for the community, the holders, the builders, the developers, and the believers.

We pride ourselves on supporting multiple communities and networks such as:

- NuCypher, which we have been supporting as early as CASI testnet
- Cosmos Network
- Irisnet
- Kava Labs
- E-Money
- Tezos
- Icon
- Solana
- Celo

Our talented global team has a strong track record of outstanding execution in Network Infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Finance. It is this combination of innovation, intellectual capital and diversity that enables us to provide distinct and effective services for our clients and partners.

## Our Architecture

We understand the importance of providing a highly available architecture with 24/7 uptime and monitoring. Leveraging on our experience on other Proof-of-Stake networks, we run multiple nodes in a sentry architecture using multiple cloud providers such as GCP and Digital Ocean, and tools such as Grafana for constant monitoring and alerting.

## Our Guiding Principles

### Empower the billions

We believe that blockchain will reshape the financial services industry, enabling billions of people to connect with each other and transfer value in a seamless manner. Yet, real-life use of blockchain technology is still limited.

### Provide top-notch infrastructure

For new mainstream applications to develop, a lot of work is still needed at the infrastructure level. Proof-of-Work has limitations in terms of scaling and energy efficiency. We believe that the future of blockchain lies in other consensus alternatives, such as Proof-of-Stake. Staking is the new mining, and any token holder can take part in this process by leveraging on us.

### Build the internet of blockchain

Blockchains have remained siloed for the past decade, which has limited scalability and created competing ecosystems that do not communicate with each other. It is our view that the future of blockchain also lies in interoperability protocols. That’s why we are big supporters of ecosystems such as Icon, Cosmos and Polkadot.

#### _Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability_

_Staking and cryptocurrencies investment involves a high degree of risk and there is always the possibility of loss, including the loss of all staked digital assets. Additionally, delegators are at risk of slashing in case of security or liveness faults on some PoS protocols. We advise you to do your own due diligence before choosing a validator._
