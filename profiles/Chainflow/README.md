# Chainflow

Chainflow is a dedicated, capable and independent validator operator. Our hope is that decentralization results in a fairer distribution of power, wealth, and opportunity. We believe that smaller operators like ourselves are critical to decentralizing stake distribution.

We've operated validators since October 2017. We've been involved with NuCypher since the first testnets in early 2019. We also helped the NuCypher team develop their CASI incentivized testnet.
